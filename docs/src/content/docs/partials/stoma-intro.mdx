_Named after the tiny pores in plant leaves that regulate what passes through,
Stoma gives you the same fine-grained control over your API traffic._

Stoma is a **declarative API gateway you define in TypeScript** and deploy
with your standard workflow. Instead of maintaining a separate proxy service
with YAML files or admin dashboards, you define routes, policies, and upstreams
as typed objects in your codebase - version-controlled, PR-reviewed, and
deployed through your existing pipeline.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Gateway as Code" icon="seti:typescript">
    Configured with **code, not YAML**. Version your gateway in Git, review changes in PRs, and rollback with your standard deployment pipeline.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type-Safe Ergonomics" icon="pencil">
    Full type safety from configuration to runtime. Your editor provides autocomplete for policies and upstreams, catching mistakes before your users do.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Extra Infrastructure" icon="rocket">
    No sidecars, no control planes, no admin UIs. Define your gateway in code and deploy it with your existing pipeline.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-runtime" icon="external">
    Runs on Cloudflare Workers, Node.js, Deno, Bun, Fastly, Lambda@Edge, and more - using standard Web APIs.
