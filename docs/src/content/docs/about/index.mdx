## The project

Stoma is built and maintained with 💚 in the EU. 🇪🇺

It was born from a simple observation: running dedicated API gateway infrastructure is 
wasteful - wasteful of compute, wasteful of energy, and wasteful of developer time.

Stoma believes gateway logic belongs in your codebase, can be deployed to shared edge infrastructure, where it consumes resources only 
when handling actual traffic. That conviction shapes every design decision in Stoma - from its single runtime dependency, 
to its tree-shakeable policies, to its priority-ordered pipeline that short-circuits as early as possible.
