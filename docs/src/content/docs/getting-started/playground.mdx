This page runs a **fully-featured, real Stoma gateway** inside a service worker in your browser. 

Every request below goes through the same policy pipeline that runs in production - rate limiting, caching, auth, timeout - all executing locally.

<Aside type="tip" title="Things to try">
- Click **GET /echo** twice - the second response is a cache `HIT` (check the `x-cache` header)
- Click **GET /echo** 6 times within 30 seconds - the 6th request returns `429 Too Many Requests`
- Click **GET /protected** without a key, then **GET /protected (with key)** - see the `401` → `200` difference
- Click **GET /slow** - the handler sleeps for 2 seconds but the timeout policy cuts it off at 1 second

<Aside type="note" title="How it works">
The playground uses a [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) to intercept `/playground/api/*` requests. Inside the worker, a Stoma gateway is configured with:

- **IndexedDB** for rate limit counters (persists across page reloads)
- **Cache API** for response caching (standard browser API)
- **In-memory** circuit breaker state (resets on SW restart)

No network requests leave your browser. View the [playground source code](https://github.com/vivero-dev/stoma/tree/main/docs/src/playground) to see how it's built.
