## Quick Reference

| Runtime | Adapter | Storage | Best For |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Cloudflare Workers | `cloudflareAdapter` | KV, Durable Objects | Edge-first, global latency |
| Node.js | `nodeAdapter` | In-memory / Redis | Traditional servers |
| Docker | `memoryAdapter` | In-memory / Redis | Containers, Kubernetes |
| Bun | `bunAdapter` | In-memory | Fast servers, Serverless |

## Choosing a Runtime

### Edge Runtimes (Cloudflare Workers)

Choose edge deployment when you need:
- Global low latency
- Zero cold starts
- Built-in DDoS protection
- Auto-scaling without configuration

### Container Runtimes (Docker)

Choose containers when you need:
- Kubernetes/ECS integration
- Full control over runtime
- Complex networking setups
- Existing container infrastructure

### Server Runtimes (Node.js, Bun)

Choose server deployment when you need:
- WebSocket support
- Long-running processes
- Complex state management
- Integration with existing Node.js services
