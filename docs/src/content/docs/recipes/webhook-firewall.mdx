import { Code } from 'astro:components';
import EditorLink from '../../../components/EditorLink.astro';
import webhookFirewall from '@examples/webhook-firewall/gateway.ts?raw';

## Use Case

Accept third-party webhooks safely by layering authentication, size limits, and threat checks before your internal handler/service sees the request.

## Recipe

<Code code={webhookFirewall} lang="ts" title="examples/webhook-firewall/gateway.ts" />
<EditorLink code={webhookFirewall} title="Webhook Firewall" />

## Why it works

- Rejects spoofed senders early.
- Rejects malformed/oversized payloads before app logic.
- Contains abuse with bounded request rate.
